# beancount-basics

This repository is an introduction to using
[Beancount](https://github.com/beancount/beancount), with practical
examples and simple code written from first principles. I wrote this to help
others get started with Beancount's approach to double entry accounting. I
found it was difficult to get started because the concept was new to me
and I was unsure how much code I needed to write on my own. Once I got
started I quickly saw how the approach comes together. Beancount is now
the quick, powerful and assuring method I used to track all of my finances.

The repository is organized into a number of steps that build on
one another, each with their own documentation and their own
self-contained ledger and code.

* **[0-Starting-ledger/](0-Starting-ledger/README.md)**: A basic ledger
  that acts as the foundation. There's no code yet at this stage.
* **[1-First-importer/](1-First-importer/README.md)**: A simple importer
  to demonstrate how to add transactions to the ledger.
